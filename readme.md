Hello, traveller!

Welcome to my repository!

Here is presented my first programming code ever. It's dedicaded as a low level image classification neural network. As a 3 weeks python user I have used classical TensorFlow image recognition tutorial as a base, then I added additional strings to do code more coplex and fresh.

I'm going to work hard to make my code better ;)
